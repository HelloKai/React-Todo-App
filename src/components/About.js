             <h4>Hello! I am Kai Ann :D</h4>
             <p id="desc">Currently an engineer-in-training pursuing my studies in NTU, I am an aspiring software engineer!</p>
             <p id="desc">As my course mainly focuses on the hardware aspects of engineering, I haven't had much opportunities to learn about coding. Prior to this, I have worked on a project to build a movie booking website although my role was to work on the backend using PHP and SQL.
               Therefore, I would like to join the Techladies bootcamp so I can build up my portfolio, and hopefully land a software engineering job when I graduate this December!
               Aside from learning React, I am concurrently picking up android development to broaden my scope.^^ </p>
